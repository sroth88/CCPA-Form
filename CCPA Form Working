  As a California resident, you have the right to:
subquestion: |
  - **Know** the types of personal information a business collects and what it may do with it,       and about Californians’ CCPA rights as well as **see** the specific pieces of personal           information a business has collected about you.
  - **Delete** (some of) the personal information a business has collected about you.
  - **Opt-out of the sale** of your personal information.
  
  Some of the rights the CCPA grants are automatic, while others require you to take steps to     exercise them.

  For example, California citizens have the right not to be discriminated         against by a business for exercising their CCPA rights. In contrast, California residents must   notify businesses when they want to know, delete, or opt-out of the sale of their personal       information.
